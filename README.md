# etymon
Chrome-based web browser with a TUI frontend.

Core principles:
- Javascript handled by headless chrome so that it doesn't need to be rendered; good for TTY environments; Lynx can't do this for example.
- Simple configuration with few standard features, but permits extensibility with perl & lua scripts, and keyboard configuration
- Hooks for scraping and inspection tools/scripts
- Html editing lol
